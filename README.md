## Introduction

`Client Tools` is a Fabric client-side mod for Minecraft 1.21. It provides six practical automation tools:

- **`/ccraft`** — Automated crafting chain execution with multi-source material scanning and optimal crafting plan generation
- **`/ctimer`** — Timed command scheduler supporting repetitive execution with configurable intervals and counts
- **`/cchat`** — Quick chat message sender
- **`/cfly`** — Flight toggle with jump and status display
- **`/csweep`** — Snake-pattern area traversal for automated clearing (works with projection printers and auto-mining mods)
- **`/csequence`** — mcfunction sequence editor and executor with external editor support, nesting, and looping

All features run entirely on the client side. No server-side installation is required.

## Features

### `/ccraft` — Automated Crafting

- Auto-detect crafting station and input/output containers from the block you are looking at
- Smart multi-source material scanning — detects available materials in the input chest and builds an optimal crafting plan
- Full crafting chain analysis — automatically handles intermediate crafting steps (e.g., planks → sticks → tools)
- Configurable target count with infinite mode (crafts until materials run out or output is full)
- **Per-setting clear** — individually clear source, product, station, input, output, or count without resetting everything
- **Enhanced block highlight (`/ccraft show`)** — customizable duration and per-position colors with tab-completion for named colors (red, green, blue...) and hex values
- Real-time status with contextual hints — shows stop command when running, run command when ready
- Container timeout and retry handling
- Real-time progress tracking during execution

### `/ctimer` — Timed Command Scheduler

- Execute any command repeatedly at configurable intervals
- Support for human-readable durations: `1s`, `5m`, `1h`, `500ms`, `20t` (ticks)
- Configurable repeat count or infinite loop
- List, stop all, or stop by pattern matching
- Multiple independent timers run concurrently

### `/cfly` — Flight Toggle

- Toggle flight on/off with a single command
- `jump` subcommand to enable flight and jump simultaneously
- `status` subcommand to check flight permission, active state, and gamemode
- Automatically syncs abilities to the server

### `/csweep` — Snake-Pattern Area Traversal

- Select a cuboid area with two corner positions (`pos1` / `pos2`)
- Snake-pattern path generation with configurable station spacing (based on radius)
- **Continuous smooth movement** — linear interpolation between stations at constant speed, no stop-and-go
- **Dynamic cuboid adjustment** — expand or contract the cuboid boundary based on your viewing direction
- **Does not lock camera** — uses position-only packets, you keep full view control
- Independent highlight toggles: green outline wireframe, cyan path preview (gray for visited segments)
- **Pause & resume with full persistence** — progress survives game restarts, pause acts as toggle
- Live speed adjustment — change flight speed mid-operation
- Designed to work alongside projection printers and auto-mining mods

### `/cchat` — Quick Chat Sender

- Send chat messages directly from the command line
- Useful for automation scripts and quick communication

### `/csequence` — mcfunction Sequence Executor

- Edit `.mcfunction` files with your system's default text editor from within Minecraft
- Execute commands sequentially with configurable delay between each line
- Supports **nested sequences** — a sequence can call another, which can call another (up to 10 levels deep)
- **Cycle detection** — prevents infinite recursion (A→B→A is blocked automatically)
- Loop mode for repeating sequences
- All sequence files are stored in `config/client-tools/sequences/`

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)
2. Place the built `client-tools-x.y.z.jar` into your `mods/` directory
3. Launch the game

### `/ccraft` Quick Start

```
--- Basic setup ---
/ccraft product minecraft:diamond_pickaxe   — Set the item you want to craft
/ccraft input                                — Set input chest (look at it)

```

**Duration formats:** `3s` (seconds), `10t` (ticks), `1m` (minutes), `500ms` (milliseconds)

**Color formats:** named (`red`, `green`, `blue`, `gold`, `yellow`, `cyan`, `magenta`, `white`, `orange`, `purple`, `pink`, `lime`, `aqua`, `navy`, `teal`, `brown`, `gray`, `black`) or hex (`FF5555`, `#FF5555`, `0xFF5555`)

Use **Tab** to auto-complete durations and colors in the `show` command.

/cfly jump               — Enable flight and jump
/cfly status             — Check flight state
```

### `/csweep` Quick Start

```
--- Setup ---
/csweep pos1              — Set first corner (look at block, or use player position)
/csweep pos1 100 64 200   — Set first corner manually
/csweep pos2              — Set opposite corner
/csweep radius 5          — Set station spacing radius (default 4, range 1–64)
/csweep speed 15          — Set flight speed in blocks/sec (default 10, range 0.5–100)

--- Adjust cuboid ---
/csweep expand 5          — Expand the cuboid 5 blocks along the face you're looking at
/csweep contract 3        — Shrink the cuboid 3 blocks along the face you're looking at

--- Highlight ---
/csweep show              — Check current show settings
/csweep show outline      — Toggle green cuboid wireframe
/csweep show path         — Toggle cyan snake-path preview (works before starting!)

--- Control ---
/csweep start             — Start sweep (or resume if paused state exists)
/csweep pause             — Pause at current station / resume if paused (toggle)
/csweep stop              — Stop and clear pause state
/csweep status            — View config, progress, and pause state
/csweep reset             — Clear all settings
```

**Persistence:** Pause state (current station index) is saved per-world to `config/client-tools/sweep/<world-id>.json`. You can disconnect, restart the game, and resume from where you left off with `/csweep start`.

**Speed adjustment:** Change speed anytime with `/csweep speed <value>` — takes effect immediately even while running.

**Cuboid adjustment:** Use `expand`/`contract` to adjust the cuboid boundary after setup. The mod determines which face to adjust based on your viewing direction — look at the face you want to move and run the command. Works for all six faces (±X, ±Y, ±Z).

**Smooth movement:** The sweep no longer stops at each station. The player moves continuously along the path at constant speed with linear interpolation between waypoints — faster and more natural.

### `/cchat` Quick Start

```
/cchat Hello everyone!         — Send "Hello everyone!" in chat
```

### `/csequence` Quick Start

```
--- Editing ---
/csequence new daily           — Create an empty daily.mcfunction and open in external editor
/csequence edit daily          — Open daily.mcfunction in external editor
/csequence folder              — Open the sequences folder in file explorer
/csequence list                — List all saved sequences
/csequence delete daily        — Delete daily.mcfunction

--- Execution ---
/csequence run daily           — Run daily.mcfunction (1-tick delay, no loop)
/csequence run daily 1s        — Run with 1-second delay between commands
/csequence run daily 500ms loop— Run with 500ms delay, repeat forever
/csequence run farm 5t loop    — Run with 5-tick delay, loop

--- Control ---
/csequence stop                — Stop the running sequence
/csequence status              — Show current progress, nesting depth, and call stack
```

**mcfunction format:** Standard Minecraft function syntax — one command per line, `#` for comments, blank lines ignored.

**Nested sequences:** Use `/csequence run <name>` inside a sequence file to call another sequence. The parent pauses, the child runs to completion, then the parent resumes. Cycle detection prevents infinite recursion.

**External editor:** Uses your system's default text editor (Notepad, VSCode, etc.). On Windows, also falls back to `cmd /c start` if the Java Desktop API is unavailable.
